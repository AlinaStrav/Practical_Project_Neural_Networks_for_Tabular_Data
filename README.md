# Practical_Project_Neural_Networks_for_Tabular_Data
My practical project when I studied Artificial Intelligence

Task: 
You will need to create a separate notebook, choose an example - 1 of those 6 - and improve it.
How can you improve it, there are a few ways:
  - Either tune model to be more precise, accurate (dropout, batch size tunning, batch norm, embeddings).
  -  implement at least 1 TODO task written at the end of the notebook (indicate which one).
  - Add error / acc. vs. epoch visualization, decision boundary visualization, regression line visualization.
  - Or come up with some kind of another improvement on your own (indicate which one).
